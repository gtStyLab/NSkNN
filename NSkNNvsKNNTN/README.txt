MVdata contains 100 missing value datasets (generated by the MNAR-T model) for each condition tested to compare NS-kNN and KNN-TN.

rawData contains the 3 complete datasets (from www.metabolomicsworkbench.org) in a CSV format.

resultsMATLAB_NSkNN contains the NS-kNN imputation error results generated in MATLAB.

resultsR_KNNTN contains the KNN-TN imputation error results generated in R.

driver_calcErrorMATLAB.m imputes the missing value datasets in MVdata and calculates the imputation errors using NS-kNN in MATLAB.

driver_calcErrorR.r imputes the missing value datasets in MVdata and calculates the imputation errors using kNN-TN in R. It is edited from the code found in Shah et. al. BMC Bioinformatics (2017).

Imputation_Functions.r contains the necessary functions needed for driver_calcErrorR.r and the NRMSE calculation is edited from the code found in Shah et. al. BMC Bioinformatics (2017).
