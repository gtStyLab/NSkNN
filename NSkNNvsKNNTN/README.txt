resultsMATLAB_NSkNN_MM contains the NS-kNN, kNN (EU), and kNN (PC) imputation error results generated in MATLAB.

resultsR_KNNTN_MM contains the KNN-TN imputation error results generated in R.

driver_calcErrorMATLAB_MM.m imputes the missing value datasets generated by generatedMissingFiles_MM.m and calculates the imputation errors using NS-kNN, kNN (EU), and kNN (PC) in MATLAB. Generated csv files contain results for NS-kNN in the first column, results for kNN (EU) in the second column, and results for kNN (PC) in the third column.

driver_calcErrorR_MM.r imputes the missing value datasets generated by generatedMissingFiles_MM.m and calculates the imputation errors using kNN-TN in R. It is edited from the code found in Shah et. al. BMC Bioinformatics (2017).

generatedMissingFiles_MM.m generates missing value csv files for all datasets and conditions using Mixed Missingness.

Imputation_Functions.r contains the necessary functions needed for driver_calcErrorR.r and the NRMSE calculation is edited from the code found in Shah et. al. BMC Bioinformatics (2017).

writeAsCSV_MM.R converts R files generated by driver_calcErrorR_MM.r (containing imputation errors) to csv files for importing into driver_PlotPaperFigures.m
