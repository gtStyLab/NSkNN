driver_GeneratePlotData.m generates the data for all figures in the manuscript and supplementary, except for Figure 6, S7, and S8 (see folder NSkNNvsKNNTN)

driver_NSkNN.m is an example of how NSkNN would be run on a metabolomics dataset with missing values, stored as a CSV file.

driver_PlotPaperFigures.m plots all the figures in the manuscript and supplementary using the data generated from driver_GeneratePlotData.m and NSkNNvsKNNTN. Legacy result files for recreating exact figures in the paper are found in the results folder.
